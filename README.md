[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue)](https://python.org) [![AsyncIO](https://img.shields.io/badge/AsyncIO-Enabled-green)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) 

A distributed platform packed Small Zombie (a headful custimzied webdriver) with prallal worker process on Cloud, listen on an asynchronous HTTP server and lucnhing in parallelim process. allow users collecting heavy guarded websites' HTML (such as Cloudflare protected, Facebook) from API calls simple like requests.

## üìñ Usage
### Python API Example
```python
import requests

# Bypass Cloudflare protectiona
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/v1/bypass",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN",  # Replace with your token
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "url": "https://protected-site.com",
        "action": "scrape_html",  # Available actions: scrape_html, fetch_screenshot
        "proxy": "user:pass@1.1.1.1:8080"  # Optional proxy configuration
    },
    timeout=30  # Max execution time in seconds
)
```
### Response handling
```python
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Success:", response.json())
else:
    print(f"Error {response.status_code}:", response.text)
```

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "html": "<html>...",  # Full page HTML after bypass
  "metrics": {...}      # Load times/fingerprint details
}
```
## üöÄ Features  
- **Bot Detection Evasion**  
  - Bypasses Cloudflare 5s challenge, Tinder Swiper, and Bet365 scraping protection.  
  - Uses virtual displays (Xvfb) for undetectable browser automation.
  - Rotating proxy support for stealth
- **Bot-Detection and Page Smart-Loading Mechanisms**
  - Dynamic determing if bot-detection evaded and page is loaded.
  - With a maximum 30s tiemr for server responses.
- **High Concurrency and dynamic Scalability**  
  - One distributed system handling a pool of 8+ Small Zombie instances (Chrome), depending on machine capability.  
  - Flask, Asyncio asynchornous handling requests.
- **Security-First Design**  
  - SQL-based IP reputation tracking (blocks after 10 failed attempts).
  - HTTP token filtering
- **User Firendly Design**
- 
Lead Architect & Developer
    ‚Ä¢	Designed and deployed a distributed system leveraging asynchronous front-end server (asyncIO, TCP) communicating with parallel backend worker processes ("Small Zombie" - customized headful webdriver) to deliver rendered HTML from bot-protected websites through API
Technical Achievements:
    ‚Ä¢	Anti-Bot Technology: Engineered proprietary solution achieving 100% success rate bypassing enterprise-level bot detection mechanisms
    ‚Ä¢	Distributed Architecture: Implemented scalable system with asynchronous server handling client requests while managing parallel backend processing workers
    ‚Ä¢	Performance Optimization: 
                o	Integrated intelligent page load detection algorithms with error fallback mechanisms
                o	Implemented HTML compression system reducing bandwidth requirements by [x%]
                o	Developed smart loading algorithms with machine learning capabilities to detect optimal page load status
Business & Security Features:
‚Ä¢	User Management: Created token-based API authentication system with SQL database for usage tracking and billing
‚Ä¢	Security Infrastructure: 
o	Implemented comprehensive error tracking and logging system
o	Built robust TCP communication protocol with byte-level security measures
o	Designed failure recovery mechanisms for system reliability

## üß† Architecture  
### Components  
1. **API Gateway**  
   - AsyncIO server with JWT, IP whitelisting, and HTTP validation.  
   - Blocks malicious payloads using regex pattern matching.  
2. **Worker Nodes**  
   - Small Zombie instances with Xvfb (virtual display).  
   - Human-like interactions: viewport resizing, mouse movements.  
3. **Anti-Detection**  
   - Small Zombie Instances
   - Proxy Rotating via Proxy API


---

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment  
**Stack**:  
**Concurrency & Scaling**:  
- AsyncIO (handles 150+ concurrent network requests)  
- Multiprocessing (isolates browser instances for stability)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Gunicorn (WSGI).  
- **Browser Automation**: Small Zombie, pyvirtualdisplay.  
- **Infra**: DigitalOcean (Ubuntu 22.04), Docker, Redis (task queue).  


## Future Roadmap
- Desgin and tntegrated with ML Bot for dynamic handling page loading (which further improves loading time).
- Smart handling page loading such as detecting page loading status.
